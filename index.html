                        <p>
                            There are two main concepts that are fundamental to the way the Internet functions: packets
                            and
                            protocols.
                        </p>
                        <section id="packets">
                            <h2>Packets</h2>
                            <p>
                                In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Each packet contains
                                both
                                data and information about that data. When data gets sent over the Internet, it is first
                                broken up into smaller packets, which are then translated into bits. Packets are sent
                                across
                                the Internet using a technique called packet switching. Intermediary routers and
                                switches
                                are able to process packets independently from each other, without accounting for their
                                source or destination.

                            <p>
                                In networking, a protocol is a standardized way of doing certain actions and formatting
                                data so that two or more devices are able to communicate with and understand each
                                other.
                                There are protocols for sending packets between devices on the same network (Ethernet),
                                for sending packets from network to network (IP), for ensuring those packets
                                successfully
                                arrive in order (TCP), and for formatting data for websites and applications (HTTP). In
                                addition to these foundational protocols, there are also protocols for routing, testing,
                                and
                                encryption. And there are alternatives to the protocols listed above for different types
                                of
                                content - for instance, streaming video often uses UDP instead of TCP.

                        <p>
                            A server is a computer that runs applications and services ranging from websites to instant
                            messaging.
                            It's called a server because it provides a service to another computer and its user also
                            known as the client.
                            Is typically stored in something called a data center with hundreds or thousands of other
                            servers, all running different services connected to the internet.
                            A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and
                            other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job
                            of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering
                            webpages to users.

                                A website is a combination or collection of webpages grouped together, often handled by
                                a person or an organisation, which can be accessed anywhere and anytime by anyone via
                                the internet. This is also a good method to market the businesses and help
                                them grow well. Al these pages are linked together using the hyperlinks. Websites can
                                also
                                be either static or interactive. In the meantime, some popular categories of
                                websites are affiliate websites, e-commerce websites, dating websites, social networking
                                websites and more.

                                like the Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and so on. This is used to make up the World Wide
                                Web (WWW) and is used chiefly to sell products and services to users or visitors. A

                                URL address is also attached to the webpages and is used to render or access that
                                particular page. Webpages can also be either static or dynamic.

                            A web browser takes you anywhere on the internet. It retrieves information from other parts
                            of the web and displays it on your desktop or mobile device. The information is transferred
                            using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which defines how text, images and video are
                            transmitted on the web.
                            When the web browser fetches data from an internet connected server, it uses a piece of
                            software called a rendering engine to translate that data into text and images. This data is
                            written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and web browsers read this code to create
                            what we see, hear and experience on the internet.

                            <h3>Shared Hosting</h3>
                            <p>
                                Shared hosting is the most common type of web hosting and is suitable for most online
                                business owners. With shared hosting, several customers share storage space on one
                                powerful server. There are several advantages to shared hosting including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Affordability - It's much cheaper to share the space on a server than to rent the
                                    entire
                                    machine.</li>
                                <li>Ease of use- Your server is preconfigured, well-organized, easy to use, and your
                                    hosting
                                    company does all the maintenance and security updates for you.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Dedicated Hosting</h3>
                            <p>
                                Rather than sharing space, you get a server all to yourself if you choose a dedicated
                                hosting
                                package. Advantages to dedicated hosting include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Customization - You can customize the software and hardware to meet your individual
                                    needs
                                </li>
                                <li>Unlimited Resources- Since you don't share the server with anyone, all the storage
                                    space
                                    is
                                    yours.</li>
                                <li>Full control - You can configure the setup however you'd like.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>VPS Hosting</h3>
                            <p>
                                Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting includes all the features of a dedicated server,
                                but at
                                the price point of a shared server. Here are some of the top reasons VPS hosting might
                                be
                                a great fit:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Functionality - VPS hosting is built on a cPanel and supports easy navigation with
                                    several
                                    intuitive tools.</li>
                                <li>One-click features - You have access to one-click installs of WordPress, Magento,
                                    and
                                    Drupal.
                                </li>
                                <li>Easy site navigation - The clean interface makes site management a cinch.</li>

                            <p>Cloud hosting is often considered the most reliable of all of the services. Rather than

                                never have any downtime. Other benefits include:

                        <p>
                            The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing
                            packets of
                            data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data
                            traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is
                            attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right
                            place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP address, and
                            as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.
                            Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on
                            which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport
                            protocols are TCP and UDP.

                        <h1>HTTP</h1>
                        <p>
                            Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting
                            hypermedia
                            documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web
                            servers,
                            but
                            it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a
                            client
                            opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a
                            stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two
                            requests.

                        <h1>What is an API Application Programming Interface?</h1>
                        <p>
                            The term API, also known as Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols and
                            definitions that can allow one application to communicate with the other application. It is
                            a computing interface that is being used to define interactions between various software
                            intermediaries. It will define the kinds of requests and calls that can be made. It is an
                            information gateway that will allow the software and services' backend to communicate
                            with each other.

                        <h1>What is an IDE?</h1>
                        <p>
                            An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the
                            different aspects of writing a computer program. IDEs increase programmer productivity
                            by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing
                            source code, building executables, and debugging.
